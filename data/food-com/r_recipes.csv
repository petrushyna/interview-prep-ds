to be completely honest, i opt not to dig out my spring form pan and cheat by buying ready made crust from the store. although, i have included ingredients and instructions for a crust for those who are looking for a completely home made cake. however, if you are as lazy as i am and go with the ready made crust … tip: keep that aluminum edge (that keeps the clear plastic lid on) folded up, making an extra lip. it will help hold more cheesecake, and keep it from overflowing. this is a nice, thick cheesecake!

i baked 2 pieces at a time on baking paper on an oven tray. each batch took just long enough to cook, that i had two more ready to swap when the first ones were done.

the cream filling (and coating) is made from sour cream and sugar. the sour cream is simply whipped with the sugar until the sugar dissolves. the original recipe said to add sugar ""by intuition""; i think you're supposed to keep adding more until it thickens, but the time i tried that it was too sickly sweet!

i have also made the filling/coating using fresh cream - 750ml, soured with 1/2 cup lemon juice and beaten until just starting to thicken (you still use the sugar & honey). this was for a vegetarian who pointed out that the cultured sour cream i used had gelatin in it. a slightly different taste, but a very nice variation.

i personally don't like walnuts all that much, so i leave them out whenever i cook this.","['eggs', 'sugar', 'baking soda', 'liquid honey', 'margarine', 'flour', 'sour cream', 'honey', 'plain sweet biscuit crumbs', 'ground walnuts']",10,

(tip: asian markets have potato starch and tapioca and rice flour too)
this recipe is butter-basted white bread; i got this from a book in the library, i cannot remember the title or author.
i make this bread for my mother and friend who cannot have gluten in their diet.  they rave that this is better than the small store loafs and love that it cuts without crumbling and ideal for sandwiches, toast etc, they both prefer the 1 white/1 brown rice flour mix with linseed and sunflower seeds for taste and texture.  
the minimum setting i have on my bread machine is 4 hours, the bread cooks fine on this for me.
produces a smaller loaf than wheat bread loafs but still a decent size.","['rice flour', 'potato starch', 'tapioca flour', 'xanthan gum', 'powdered milk', 'salt', 'egg substitute', 'sugar', 'water', 'dry yeast', 'butter', 'vinegar', 'eggs', 'linseeds', 'sunflower seeds']",15,

this recipe is great for serving to a large amount of people.

*note: you use a whole (8-piece cut) chicken if you want to serve 6-8, but if you are serving more than 6, for the purposes of the stock, use only split leg quarters.

the recipe is best when fresh ingredients are used, especially cilantro. don't even bother with the recipe if you don't have fresh cilantro.

after the chicken is fully cooked, you can try to fish it out and separate the meat from the bones, but i don't usually bother with it.","['water', 'whole chicken', 'chicken bouillon cubes', 'fresh cilantro', 'fresh mint leaves', 'onion', 'green bell pepper', 'garlic cloves', 'seville oranges', 'red potatoes', 'yucca root', 'corn', 'plantains', 'tomatoes']",14,

serve these with hot cider on a crisp fall day; with a scoop of lemon ice cream; dunked in cold milk; or alongside sliced apples and cheddar cheese. these are wonderful to include in christmas packages because they ship very well.

crystallized ginger can usually be found in the bulk food section of natural food stores, or in the jarred spice section of regular grocery stores. i have also seen ""baking cut"" ginger at trader joe's and in the king arthur flour catalog, which eliminates the need for chopping. 

if you get the crystallized ginger in bulk, scoop some extra ginger ""crumbs"" from the bottom of the bin, and roll the balls of dough in this (instead of the turbinado sugar) before baking.

tips for chopping the (very sticky) ginger:  use scissors, or pulse in a food processor for 20 seconds.

be advised that the dough must chill for an hour before shaping into balls, and again for 10 minutes before baking, so give yourself enough time.

this recipe is easily doubled (and after you taste them, you'll wish you had).

tips:
do not let this hot slaw sit around with dressing in it. it must be fresh!
don't over fill the bowl with dressing. i personally like just enough dressing to wet the cabbage and bacon and not a drop more.
make a whole gallon of dressing and bacon bits and store what you don't use for later. at forest view gardens, we made 30 gallons of dressing and 200 pounds of bacon bits on thursday and it lasted the whole week!","['cabbage', 'bacon', 'water', 'vegetable oil', 'white vinegar', 'sugar', 'salt', 'fresh garlic']",8,

agni or the “digestive fire,” is one of the most important principles in the ancient science of ayurveda. it refers broadly to our ability to process all aspects of life, including food, experiences, memories, and sensory impressions. agni is responsible for absorbing the nutrients and essential elements the body needs while burning off waste products (agni is the root of the english word “ignite”).

if our agni is strong, we’re able to digest food efficiently and easily assimilate our daily experiences. on the other hand, if agni is weak, our body won’t digest well, creating toxic residue or ama that lodges deep in our cells.

according to ayurvedic teaching, strong agni leads to excellent health and well-being, while the accumulation of ama results in the slow deterioration of the body and ultimately, disease. the inability to metabolize emotions produces just as much toxic residue as undigested food. in fact, pent-up anger, long-held sadness, and lingering guilt are more debilitating for most people than problems with physical digestion.
